## AIO-CTM
A more accurate look to one of the first ores in the game!

A very small resource pack that recolors the iron ore.

This is the connected and emissive textures version of the resource pack! If you want a version without these features, go here: [Accurate Iron Ore](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/accurate-iron-ore)

## For connected textures and emissive textures, be sure to have [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) or [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) installed!

To install, just open your .minecraft/resourcepacks and throw the zip file in for your version. Then go into Minecraft, Options, Resource Packs, and add it, and you are good to go!

I hope you enjoy it!
